            <div id="abs1" class="pub-abs">Why do people, socialized and sedimented in their political beliefs, change their convictions in adulthood? Belief change has a long history of research in the social sciences. Yet, in quantitative research, belief change is studied largely through cognitive and behavioral lenses, that, however valuable, struggle to capture how people themselves experience and narrate transformation and how this is made meaningful and sustained as a social process. Additionally, qualitative studies on belief change remain marginal in the field and are often confined to case-specific analyses of radical conversions. In response to this gap, this paper develops a qualitative and narrative approach to studying belief change. First, we argue that belief change is biographically situated, culturally mediated and socially embedded. Then, we draw on two contrasting case studies – on turning towards conspiracy theories and gaining anti-racist awareness through film – to find ‘master narratives’ of belief change. We offer a framework that distinguishes three recurring narrative steps, rooted in cultural repertoires: retrospective constructions of past selves, narrations of transformation, and interpretations of present selves in relation to these transformations. This theoretical and methodological framework aims to contribute to the further understanding of belief change as not only an attitudinal shift but a reworking of one’s life story.</div>

            <div id="abs2" class="pub-abs">Social media platforms like YouTube are often seen as gateways for the spread of conspiracy theories. While much of the research has focused on why people consume conspiracy theory content, little attention has been given to how individuals become creators of such content. This paper addresses this gap by examining how conspiratorial online practices emerge from social and cultural contexts mediated by social media platforms and communities of practice. Drawing on 22 in-depth interviews and ethnographic fieldwork, this study explores the biographies of conspiracy YouTubers, revealing three key moments in their trajectories: the reinterpretation of pre-existing worldviews, integration into a community of practice, and the pursuit of self-promotion and branding. The findings not only contribute to understanding the life experiences that draw people to the conspiracy milieu but also underscore how online environments cultivate and sustain such conspiracy micro-celebrities.</div>

            <div id="abs3" class="pub-abs">Due to growing public concerns regarding the consequences of disinformation and conspiracy theories, major tech companies have introduced policies to curtail them on their platforms. Until now, the academic debate has largely focused on whether these punitive policies are effective. In this study, we address the question of how de-platformed ‘conspiracy theorists’ themselves experience and deal with such socio-technological exclusion. Drawing on seminal theories in the symbolic interactionist tradition, we conceptualize conspiracy theories as stigmatized ‘knowledge’ and empirically study the ways that conspiracy theory producers manage their stigma after de-platforming. Particularly, we draw on an analysis of 22 in-depth, qualitative interviews, ethnographic observations with (former) conspiracy YouTubers and a digital ethnography. Our findings demonstrate that YouTubers respond to de-platforming by emphasizing the ‘silver linings’ of their exclusion and by accommodating, bypassing and reframing their ‘stigma’. De-platforming contributes to their legitimacy in the face of their audiences and enables them to carve out space to cultivate a new, stronger form of conspiracy capital and status. This study contributes to the literature on conspiracy theories from a cultural sociological perspective. It advances our understanding of how de-platforming may backfire, strengthening people’s beliefs and standing within their subculture.</div>

            <div id="abs4" class="pub-abs">Stuart Hall's encoding/decoding model of cultural analysis was born as a critique of linear sender/message/receiver-models of communication, which Hall argued concentrate on message exchanges without questioning who sends and who receives a message, and the political-economic asymmetry between the two. By contrast, in encoding/decoding analyses, the message itself-a television show or other entertainment media object is only a pivotal object between two ‘moments' of encoding and decoding. Encoding conceptualizes the process of how, why, and by whom a message is produced; and decoding conceptualizes how, why, and by whom the message is consumed. This chapter provides, first, an introduction to Hall and encoding/decoding as an approach to studying media entertainment; second, an overview of the theoretical challenges under-gone by researchers over the last decades to operationalize and empirically apply Hall's model; and third, an insight into the relevance to and challenges presented by 21stcentury (online, interactive, and platformized) entertainment media.</div>

            <div id="abs5" class="pub-abs">The ‘paranoid personality’ is generally understood as an individual, psychological and pathological disorder characterized by suspicion and pervasive distrust of others. Since the early works of Sigmund Freud and Carl Gustav Jung to its professional classification in DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) since the 1950s, paranoia has been mainly considered as a pathological and psychological anxiety. In this chapter, the perspective on paranoia is broadened from the psychological micro level to the sociological macro level. It is demonstrated how paranoia as a subjective experience and a clinical category is socially constructed in the 20th century and, more precisely, that this paranoid anxiety is intimately related to societal developments of (post)modernization. Building on classical sociological theory, the analysis shows how the emergence of a ‘distant’ nation-state (Émile Durkheim), accelerating rationalization of institutions (Max Weber), the invasion of late modern capitalism (Fredric Jameson), the proliferation of media images and ‘simulations’ (Jean Baudrillard) and technologically enhanced ‘surveillance’ and ‘biopolitics’ in everyday life (Michel Foucault) have induced a collective sense of paranoia and the popularization of conspiracy theories in Western countries.</div>

            <div id="abs6" class="pub-abs">The ubiquity of social media platforms fuels heated discussions about algorithms and selection biases leading people into online “echo chambers.” Scholars argue that social media deepen societal polarization and fuel political extremism. However, studies often focus on media effects, disregarding individual agency and (sub)cultural values that shape communication. As a strategic case study, this article, based on a mixed-methods analysis, including a social network and qualitative analysis of 1199 comments under four conspiracy theory comment sections on YouTube, questions how insular these spaces are? And how people in these networks communicate? We find that the discussions in our strategically sampled comments sections lie between homogeneous closed debates and open debates. In other words, the networks in our sample vary in their “echo chamberness.” Based on our findings, we contend that variations in the echo chamberness of the various comment sections can be explained via the lens of conspiratorial (sub)cultures.</div>

            <div id="abs7" class="pub-abs">Conspiracy theories are central to “post-truth” discussions. Official knowledge, backed by science, politics, and media, is distrusted by various people resorting to alternative (conspiratorial) explanations. While elite commentators lament the rise of such “untruths,” we know little of people’s everyday opinions on this topic, despite their societal ramifications. We therefore performed a qualitative content analysis of 522 comments under a Dutch newspaper article on conspiracy theories to study how ordinary people discuss post-truth matters. We found four main points of controversy: “habitus of distrust”; “who to involve in public debates”; “which ways of knowing to allow”; and “what is at stake?” The diverging opinions outline the limits of pluralism in a post-truth era, revealing tensions between technocratic and democratic ideals in society. We show that popular opinions on conspiracy theories embody more complexity and nuance than elite conceptions of post-truth allow for: they lay bare the multiple sociological dimensions of poly-truth.</div>

            <div id="abs8" class="pub-abs">Conspiracy theories were once perceived as delusions of individuals on the fringes of society, but have become commonplace in mainstream culture. Today, they are produced, consumed, and circulated on various online media environments. From memes on 4chan, QAnon influencers on Instagram, to flat earth or antivaxx videos on YouTube, modern-day conspiracy culture embodies compelling mediated images and narratives that are composed of various audiovisual materials. Building on Stuart Hall’s encoding/decoding model, and Henry Jenkins’ notion of “participatory culture,” we analyze these audiovisual conspiracy theories as “oppositional readings” of hegemonic truths. More concretely, we analyze how conspiracy theorists reconstruct various audiovisual (mass-media) materials into streamlined narratives on YouTube videos to picture opaque power. Based on an in-depth qualitative analysis of 24 conspiracy theory videos, strategically selected from a larger sample of 200, we present three major categories of audiovisual narrative construction in conspiracy videos on YouTube: (1) Simulating: using fiction, religious and cultural images and narratives to render images of events otherwise invisible; (2) Deciphering: decoding hidden messages by “closely reading” images and looking for hidden symbolism; (3) Exhibiting: exposing information, research, and images that are “hidden in plain sight” but point to conspiracy. This article contributes to the growing body of literature on conspiracy theories by showing how they are not just texts, but should better be seen as media practices involving the recontextualizing of (mass)media material into new audiovisual conspiracy theory narratives. This shapes not just their content and form, but also their place in public discourse.</div>

            <div id="abs9" class="pub-abs">Psychedelic microdosing, or taking small doses of psychedelic substances that do not induce intoxication or altered states but rather subtle outcomes such as increased focus, has quickly become a mass media phenomenon. Many claim microdosing has become the new secret to enhancement in work contexts. Drawing from literature on psychedelic microdosing, technologies of the self, self-identity and the sociology of work and leisure, this study understands microdosing as a technology individuals introduce into their lives to modify themselves for various purposes. We explore the ways in which the 1960s iconic psychedelic drugs, that once offered turning on, tuning in and dropping out, are now finding new uses across different contexts. Taking a cultural-sociological perspective, we examine how individuals use microdoses of classic psychedelic drugs and how they make sense of microdosing in their daily lives. Based on our findings, we identify three different uses of psychedelic microdosing: (1) as technology of self-esteem and control at work, (2) as a self-help technology, and (3) as a technology of ‘slow living’.</div>
